        // REPLACE THESE WITH YOUR EXACT KEYS FROM YOUR PROJECT
        // I am injecting the ones found in your environment context if possible, 
        // otherwise we will print them to console to verify they are loaded.
        
        // We need to fetch the env vars from the Next.js app or hardcode them here for the test.
        // Since this is a static file, we can't access process.env.
        // I will attempt to read them from the user's previously viewed files if available, 
        // or asking the user to verify them. 
        // For now, I will assume the user has to copy-paste them OR I can try to fetch them from a helper API.
        
        // Actually, to make this seamless, I will create a temporary API route to serve the env vars? 
        // No, that's too complex. 
        // I'll make this file use a prompt or just hardcode the keys if I have them.
        // I DO NOT have the keys in the chat context explicitly visible in the last turn. 
        // I will rely on the Supabase client file I read earlier.
        
        // Wait, I can't read variables from a static HTML file served by Next.js public folder without manual insertion.
        // I will mistakenly hardcode PLACEHOLDERS and ask the user to fill them? 
        // No, that's bad UX.
        
        // BETTER APPROACH: 
        // I'll create a new PAGE in the Next.js app `src/app/debug-realtime/page.tsx`.
        // This page will have access to `process.env` and can render the simple test logic.
        // This is much better than a static HTML file.
